# landing-page
Landing page project from The Odin Project's Foundations Course.

Here I'm going to practice my HTML, CSS, and Git.

I might style it to be a web page for my pro wrestling brand, though I'm not sure what kind of function this website will serve.

## HTML and CSS
I'm going to use basic HTML elements, and CSS Flexbox.

I might go back later and practice Grid and other tricks on this page that I find out online from resources like Juxtopposed or Hyperplexed.

## Git
As usual, I'm going to try to stick to Conventional Commits.
